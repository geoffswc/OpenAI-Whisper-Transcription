When I was 14. Any reason? Because I was trying to be cool or something. Really? Well, yeah. So you tried it because other people were doing it? Yeah, I guess. And why don't you do it anymore? A lot of reasons. I just didn't like it, you know? I don't need to smoke to, like, fit in. Hold up. We finished? Yeah. OK, I kind of want to know an answer. Sp ajust where my uncle solding. Ah, ah, no. Does your dad ever want to meet me or something like that? I'll see about that. Actually, you're just watching over me after taking a stuck and I stopped talking, and\n",

People must think that kids are all a jot in the know. Always telling us what to do or not to do. But we know what's going on. We listen. Like smoking. We all know the reasons not to. But out here, it comes up. That's when we make the real decision. And for us, it's not full of smoke. And that's not even the hardest decision I've ever made. I mean, you know? So, how about a little credit for a change? My parents. They always think I'm not listening. I hear them. Wait a minute. You know, every day you have to deal with stuff on your own. So, you want to know why I've decided not to smoke? Which reason would you like? I don't need to smoke to prove myself. My coolness is not on trial here. I don't smoke because sometimes it's what you don't do that makes you who you are. These are the kids that I hang out with. They're good. They're all cool. In different ways. But we're a lot alike, too. Because, you know, we all deal with the same stuff. Same decisions. Like smoking. Forget it. We all came up with the same answer. Not for us. We don't have to smoke to be different. Being ourselves is enough. Hey, guys. Can I ask you a couple questions? Sure. Go ahead. All right. Have you ever tried cigarettes? Nope. Why not? I don't know. I just never wanted to. You know what I mean? Really? Yeah. I mean, some of my friends shot it or whatever. Somebody had a pack at the school. You know, they're smoking or whatever. And do you think they tried it because other people were doing it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that's dumb, though. You see what I'm saying? I mean, the reason that it's dumb, they're not dumb. But that's a stupid reason to do anything. I figure. I figure. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Take it easy. Hey, you. Me? Yeah. Did you ever try cigarettes?
